    content: `React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs), particularly for single-page applications. It allows you to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage changes to the data that drives those components. Think of it like building with LEGOs: you have small, self-contained pieces (components) that you can combine to create complex structures (your UI).

Here's a breakdown of key concepts with simple examples:

1. Components:

Components are the building blocks of a React application. They can be either functional components (using functions) or class components (using JavaScript classes). Functional components are generally preferred for their simplicity.

Functional Component Example:
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

// Usage:
const element = <Welcome name="Sarah" />;
// Renders: <h1>Hello, Sarah</h1>
Class Component Example (less common now):
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}

// Usage (same as functional component):
const element = <Welcome name="Sarah" />;
// Renders: <h1>Hello, Sarah</h1>
2. JSX:

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript. React uses JSX to describe what the UI should look like. JSX gets compiled to regular JavaScript function calls.

const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>; // This is JSX
3. Props:

Props (short for properties) are how you pass data to components. They are read-only within the component. Think of them as arguments to a function.

function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>; // Accessing the 'name' prop
}

const element = <Welcome name="John" />; // Passing the 'name' prop
4. State:

State allows components to manage their own internal data. When state changes, the component re-renders to reflect the updated data.

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0); // Initial state is 0

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
In this example, count is the state variable, and setCount is a function to update the state. Clicking the button updates the count state, causing the component to re-render and display the new count.

5. Virtual DOM:

React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to efficiently update the actual DOM. When state changes, React updates the virtual DOM first, then compares it to the previous virtual DOM. It then updates only the necessary parts of the actual DOM, minimizing performance overhead.

Key Benefits of React:

Component Reusability: Build once, use everywhere.
Efficient Updates: Virtual DOM minimizes DOM manipulations.
Easy to Learn: Relatively simple API and good documentation.
Large Community: Strong community support and many available libraries.
SEO-Friendly: Server-side rendering capabilities improve SEO.
These examples provide a basic understanding of React's core concepts. As you explore further, you'll encounter more advanced topics like lifecycle methods, hooks, and routing, which allow you to build complex and dynamic web applications.`,
